"""Spectral distortions module for jaxCLASS.

Computes CMB spectral distortion parameters μ and y from energy injection.

For v1: placeholder. The primary distortion from Silk damping will be
computed from the matter power spectrum and thermodynamic history.

# Placeholder for spectral distortion computation.
# For v1, μ and y distortion parameters are not yet computed.
