Based on PROGRESS.md, here are the **top 3 accuracy bottlenecks** (ordered by impact):

## 1. **TT l=30-50 at ~1.5%** 
   - **Current status**: Converged across k-densities, so NOT a numerical resolution issue
   - **Likely cause**: Normalization issue in T1/T2 radial functions or missing term in source function assembly
   - **RSA damping already tried**: Had <0.1pp impact, ruled out as the cause
   - **Next action**: Term-by-term comparison of T_l(k) at single (l,k) against CLASS transfer.c:4168-4200
   - **Effort**: Moderate (careful debugging session, hours)
   - **Impact**: High — would bring TT to sub-percent at all cosmologically relevant scales

## 2. **TT l>700 degrades to 3-9%** (9% at l=1000)
   - **Current status**: Source interpolation and Bessel functions confirmed accurate
   - **Root cause**: Perturbation hierarchy truncation at l_max=50 affects metric via Einstein equations at high-k modes
   - **Proposed fix**: CLASS-style hard RSA switch (replace hierarchy with algebraic expressions using `jax.lax.cond`)
   - **Challenge**: Incompatible with smooth differentiability goal
   - **Effort**: Substantial (1-2 sessions)
   - **Impact**: Medium — affects only l>700, less critical for CMB science

## 3. **SW plateau (l<15) at ~5%**
   - **Root cause**: Gauge-dependent source function at super-horizon scales
   - **Effort**: Moderate
   - **Impact**: Low-medium — affects large angular scales where cosmic variance is high

---

**Key insight from the log**: The recent RSA damping attempt (Feb 10) was implemented correctly but had minimal impact, confirming the TT l=30-50 error is NOT from hierarchy ringing. The next logical step is a term-by-term audit of the T1/T2 transfer functions against CLASS source code.
